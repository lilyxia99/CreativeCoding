but then how to detailed change each of the coordinates? imagine you have so many points and so many faces, how do you keep track of each of them?

note: the view changing we didn't really talk about, but it's actually more complicated, using linear transformation. 
How many of you have learnt linear algebra?
don't worry, we will cover some in the future.

note: 
That's why you need a visualized interface to deal with all these.

note: it's an industry standard 3D software used by mainstream animation studios such as Pixar, Dreamworks and so on

--
Pros:
+ Node Based -- clear data flow
+ Industry Standards
+ Extremely Powerful
+ Compatible to Unreal
+ Powerful rendering like Arnold

Cons:
+ Difficult to learn
+ interface confusing
+ node system can't save or might crash next time opening
+ scripting language MEL (not used elsewhere, though now can use python)
